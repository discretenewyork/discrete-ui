Installation
------------

Clone or download this repo. Note that the blacktie icons are not included in
version control. You'll have to download and install those icons yourself.

    $ yarn install
    [ allow installation to complete ]
    $ npm start

Usage
------

There is currently no "distribution" build for this repo. We use it on our website by including it as a submodule
of our main repo. This allows agile bug fixes. The only concern is that you need to include everything in this
project's dependencies in your own, because you require directly from the source files, which need to be transpiled.
